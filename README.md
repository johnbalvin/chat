# About

- This is just a single chat project, it does not have automatically updates, if I someone would want to know how to do it, just create an issue and I will add it using [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) :D.
- If you want to send emails, you should [by a domain](https://domains.google) and configure with [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com), insert your crendentials into clients/mailgun and uncomment whenever there is a `sendEmail` function
